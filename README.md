# Todo-App

<font size="5">**Todo-App** is a simple application, consisting of a field for entering tasks and three sections for each case, **Open**, **In progress** and **Done**. In addition to a Nav bar.

Entered tasks are "Open" by default. The task will be listed in the "Open" menu, for each task there will be three buttons:
- Delete: to delete the task.
- ŸèEdit: to move the task between the three lists.
- Advance : to pass the task to the next list.

I haven't linked the app to a database, so the entries remain until the session is terminated.
